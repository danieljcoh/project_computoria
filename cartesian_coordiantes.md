# important for vector2s and math in game development
* Used to identify locations on a 2D plane.


## Vectors
* position vector: a vector that describes a position in space.
* Vectors can represent movement, acceleration and other quantity that has a size and direction.



Questions:
* Why is this the case: If youâ€™re new to computer graphics or game development, it might seem odd that the positive y axis points downward instead of upward, which you likely learned in math class. However, this orientation is very common in computer graphics applications.
